## 👋 Hi and welcome,  
- I'm Victor, a centennial currently living in Argentina, studying at UBA and dealing with everyday life and young adults issues as well xd. 

- 👀 I’m interested in data, of all kind to be honest. I'm just trying to learn how to extract valuable insights from day to day data, usual events and common queries.

- 🌱 Right now, I’m using free available content on places like Microsoft or Youtube (to name some) to get my cheese. I'll use Git for sure.

- 💞️ If you need and want someone to collaborate on your project, especially if it involves learning material, I could be your guy.

- 📫 If that's the case, reach me at https://estudianteporahora.home.blog/ or message me to <victortizs@outlook.com>.
