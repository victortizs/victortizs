# ¡Hola!

I'm a centennial currently living in Argentina, studying at UBA and dealing with everyday life and young adult issues too XD.

I’m interested in data, of all kind to be honest. I'm also trying to learn how to extract valuable insights from daily data, usual events and common queries. 👀

Right now I’m using free available content from places like Microsoft or Youtube (to name some) to get my cheese, and I'll be using Git for sure. 🌱

If you need and want someone to collaborate on your project, especially if involves learning material, I could be the one. 💞️

If that's the case, reach out to me at my [blog](https://estudianteporahora.com/) or [email](mailto:victortizs@outlook.com). 📫
