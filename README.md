## 👋 Hi and welcome
- I'm a centennial currently living in Argentina, studying at UBA and dealing with everyday life and young adult issues too XD.

- 👀 I’m interested in data, of all kind to be honest. I'm just trying to learn how to extract valuable insights from daily data, usual events and common queries.

- 🌱 Right now I’m using free available content from places like Microsoft or Youtube (to name some) to get my cheese. I'll use Git for sure.

- 💞️ If you need and want someone to collaborate on your project, especially if involves learning material, I could be your guy.

- 📫 If that's the case, reach me at [www.estudianteporahora.blog](https://estudianteporahora.blog/) or <victortizs@outlook.com>.
